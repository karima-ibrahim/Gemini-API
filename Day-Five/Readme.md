## Final Assignments:
## Complete Unit 5: ‚ÄúMLOps for Generative AI‚Äù, which is:
  - ‚û°Ô∏è [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode (https://youtu.be/k9S6IhiUUj4) for this unit (created by NotebookLM, https://notebooklm.google/).
  - ‚û°Ô∏è Read the ‚ÄúMLOps for Generative AI‚Äù whitepaper - https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-operationalizing-generative-ai-on-vertex-ai-using-mlops
  - ‚û°Ô∏è No code lab for today! We will do a code walkthrough and live demo of goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack (https://goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack), a resource created for making MLOps for Gen AI easier and accelerating the path to production. Please go through the repository in advance.

## üí°What You‚Äôll Learn

Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
