The emergence of foundation models and generative AI (gen AI) has introduced a new era for building AI systems. Selecting the right model from a diverse range of architectures and sizes, curating data, engineering optimal prompts, tuning models for specific tasks, grounding model outputs in real-world data, optimizing hardware - these are just a few of the novel challenges that large models introduce.
This whitepaper delves into the fundamental tenets of MLOps and the necessary adaptations required for the domain of gen AI and Foundation Models. We also examine the diverse range of Vertex AI products, specifically tailored to address the unique demands of foundation models and gen AI-based applications. Through this exploration we uncover how Vertex AI, with its solid foundations of AI infrastructure and MLOps tools, expands its capabilities to provide a comprehensive MLOps platform for gen AI.

## Final Assignments:
## Complete Unit 5: ‚ÄúMLOps for Generative AI‚Äù, which is:
  - ‚û°Ô∏è [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode (https://youtu.be/k9S6IhiUUj4) for this unit (created by NotebookLM, https://notebooklm.google/).
  - ‚û°Ô∏è Read the ‚ÄúMLOps for Generative AI‚Äù whitepaper - https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-operationalizing-generative-ai-on-vertex-ai-using-mlops
  - ‚û°Ô∏è No code lab for today! We will do a code walkthrough and live demo of goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack (https://goo.gle/e2e-gen-ai-app-starter-pack), a resource created for making MLOps for Gen AI easier and accelerating the path to production. Please go through the repository in advance.
