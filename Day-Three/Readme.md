Humans are fantastic at messy pattern recognition tasks. However, they often rely on tools - like books, Google Search, or a calculator - to supplement their prior knowledge before arriving at a conclusion. Just like humans, Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to access real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can leverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase history, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a user's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or complete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have access to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self- directed fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information that are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent, or a program that extends beyond the standalone capabilities of a Generative AI model. This whitepaper dives into all these and associated aspects in more detail.

## Day 3 Assignments:
### Complete Unit 3: ‚ÄúGenerative AI Agents‚Äù, which is:
- ‚û°Ô∏è [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode (https://youtu.be/H4gZd4BCrDQ) for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
- ‚û°Ô∏è Read the ‚ÄúGenerative AI Agents‚Äù whitepaper (https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-agents).
- ‚û°Ô∏è Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
Talk to a database with function calling - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api
Build an agentic ordering system in LangGraph - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-3-building-an-agent-with-langgraph/

## üí° What You‚Äôll Learn

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.
The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a caf√©.
