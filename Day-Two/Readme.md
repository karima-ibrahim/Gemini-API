Modern machine learning thrives on diverse data‚Äîimages, text, audio, and more. This whitepaper explores the power of embeddings, which transform this heterogeneous data into a unified vector representation for seamless use in various applications. We'll guide you through:
 Understanding Embeddings: Why they are essential for handling multimodal data and their diverse applications.
 Embedding Techniques: Methods for mapping different data types into a common vector space.
 Efficient Management: Techniques for storing, retrieving, and searching vast collections of embeddings.
 Vector Databases: Specialized systems for managing and querying embeddings, including practical considerations for production deployment.
 Real-World Applications: Concrete examples of how embeddings and vector databases are combined with large language models (LLMs) to solve real-world problems.


## Day 2 Assignments:

## üí° What You‚Äôll Learn

Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You‚Äôll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data.
