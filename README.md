## ![Day 1 : Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation & Prompt Engineering.](https://github.com/karima-ibrahim/Gemini-API/tree/main/Day-One) 

#### Authors: Mohammadamin Barektain, Anant Nawalgaria, Daniel J. Mankowitz, Majd Al Merey, Yaniv Leviathan, Massimo Mascaro, Matan Kalman, Elena Buchatskaya, Aliaksei Severyn, and Antonio Gulli, Lee Boonstra
### ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn
The evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Youâ€™ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.
The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.

# 

## ![Day 2 : Embeddings & Vector Stores.](https://github.com/karima-ibrahim/Gemini-API/tree/main/Day-Two)

#### Authors: Anant Nawalgaria and Xiaoqi Ren
### ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

The conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. Youâ€™ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data. 

# 

## ![Day 3 : Agents.](https://github.com/karima-ibrahim/Gemini-API/tree/main/Day-Three)

#### Authors: Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow and Vladimir Vuskovic
### ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn:

To build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.
The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a cafÃ©.

# 

## ![Day 4 : Solving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs.](https://github.com/karima-ibrahim/Gemini-API/tree/main/Day-Four)
#### Authors: Christopher Semturs, Shekoofeh Azizi, Scott Coull, Umesh Shankar and Wieland Holfelder
### ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

Wâ€™ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

# 

## ![Day Five : Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps.](https://github.com/karima-ibrahim/Gemini-API/tree/main/Day-Five)

#### Authors: Anant Nawalgaria, Gabriela Hernandez Larios, Elia Secchi, Mike Styer, Christos Aniftos and Onofrio Petragallo
### ðŸ’¡What Youâ€™ll Learn

Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
