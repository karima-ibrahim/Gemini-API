## Day 4 Assignments:

### Complete Unit 4: ‚ÄúDomain-Specific LLMs‚Äù, which is:
- ‚û°Ô∏è  [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode (https://youtu.be/b1a4ZOQ8XdI) for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
- ‚û°Ô∏è  Read the ‚ÄúSolving Domain-Specific Problems Using LLMs‚Äù whitepaper - https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-solving-domains-specific-problems-using-llms 
- ‚û°Ô∏è  Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
    - [Optional] Use Google Search data in generation. (Note: Grounding with Google Search has been released as a limited launch and is not available in all locations. The EEA, UK, and CH regions will be supported at a later date) - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding
    - Tune a Gemini model for a custom task - https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-fine-tuning-a-custom-model

## üí° What You‚Äôll Learn

In today‚Äôs reading, you‚Äôll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

In the code labs you will learn how to add real world data to a model beyond its knowledge cut-off by grounding with Google Search.  You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
